# UI.JS

A simple lightweight set of tools to work with DOM elements,
create styles, and states to make it all dynamic.

## Motivation

When you're working on a small, maybe even medium project,
it may be overkill to pull in something like React or Vue.
Why add 2.99MB to a simple project that only utilizes 5%
of Reacts features.

Of course there are others who made stuff like this before,
for example [Grecha.js](https://github.com/tsoding/grecha.js).
But I'd prefer to sacrifice just a little bit of that performance
for convenience.
