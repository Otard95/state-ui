# State-UI Extras

This is a set of useful extras for
[`@state-ui/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@state-ui/core).  
This is 100% optional and only build on what you get with `@state-ui/core`.

## Current state

This package and its parent `@state-ui/core` are still in active development
and you should expect breaking changes to the API.
